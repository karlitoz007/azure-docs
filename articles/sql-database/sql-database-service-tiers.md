# SQL Database options and performance: Understand what's available in each service tier
[Azure SQL Database](sql-database-technical-overview.md) offers three service tiers, **Basic**, **Standard**, and **Premium**, with multiple performance levels to handle different workloads. Higher performance levels provide increasings resources designed to deliver increasingly higher throughput. You can change [service tiers and performance levels dynamically](sql-database-scale-up.md) without downtime. Basic, Standard, and Premium service tiers all have an uptime SLA of 99.99%, flexible business continuity options, security features, and hourly billing. 

You can create single databases with dedicated resource on the [performance level](sql-database-service-tiers.md#single-database-service-tiers-and-performance-levels) selected. You can also manage multiple databases in an [elastic pool](sql-database-service-tiers.md#elastic-pool-service-tiers-and-performance-in-edtus) in which the resources are shared across the databases. The resources available for single databases are expressed in terms of Database Transaction Units (DTUs) and for elastic pools in terms of elastic DTUs (eDTUs). For more on DTUs and eDTUs, see [What is a DTU?](sql-database-what-is-a-dtu.md). 

In both cases, the service tiers include **Basic**, **Standard**, and **Premium**. 

## Choosing a service tier
The following table provides examples of the tiers best suited for different application workloads.

| Service tier | Target workloads |
| :--- | --- |
| **Basic** | Best suited for a small database, supporting typically one single active operation at a given time. Examples include databases used for development or testing, or small-scale infrequently used applications. |
| **Standard** |The go-to option for cloud applications with low to medium IO performance requirements, supporting multiple concurrent queries. Examples include workgroup or web applications. |
| **Premium** | Designed for high transactional volume with high IO performance requirements, supporting many concurrent users. Examples are databases supporting mission critical applications. |

First decide if you want to run a single database or if you want to group databases that shares resources. Review the [elastic pool considerations](sql-database-elastic-pool-guidance.md). To decide on a service tier, start by determining the minimum database features that you need:

* Max database size for individual databases (2 GB maximum for Basic, 250 GB maximum for Standard, and 500 GB to 1 TB maximum for Premium in the high end performance levels)
* Maximum total storage in case of an elastic pool (117 GB for Basic, 1200 for Standard, and 750 for Premium)
* Maximum number of databases per pool (400 for Basic, 400 for Standard, and 50 for Premium)
* Database backup retention period (7 days for Basic, 35 days for Standard and Premium)

Once you have determined the minimum service tier, you are ready to determine the performance level for the database (the number of DTUs). The standard S2 and S3 performance levels are in many cases the a good starting point. For databases with high CPU or IO requirements, the Premium performance levels are the right starting point. Premium offers more CPU and starts at 10x more IO compared to the highest Standard performance level.

After initially picking a performance level, you can and then scale the [individual database](sql-database-scale-up.md) or your [elastic pool](sql-database-elastic-pool-manage-portal.md#change-performance-settings-of-a-pool) up or down dynamically based on actual experience. For migration scenarios, you can also use the [DTU Calculator](http://dtucalculator.azurewebsites.net/) to approximate the number of DTUs needed.

## Single database service tiers and performance levels
For single databases, there are multiple performance levels within each service tier. You have the flexibility to choose the level that best meets your workloadâ€™s demands. If you need to scale up or down, you can easily change the tiers of your database. See [Changing Database Service Tiers and Performance Levels](sql-database-scale-up.md) for details.

Regardless of the number of databases hosted, your database gets a guaranteed set of resources and the expected performance characteristics of your database are not affected.

## Elastic pool service tiers and performance in eDTUs

Pools allow databases to share and consume eDTU resources without needing to assign a specific performance level to each database in the pool. For example, a single database in a Standard pool can go from using 0 eDTUs to the maximum database eDTU you set up when you configure the pool. Pools allow multiple databases with varying workloads to efficiently use eDTU resources available to the entire pool. See [Price and performance considerations for an elastic pool](sql-database-elastic-pool-guidance.md) for details.

The following table describes the characteristics of pool service tiers.

[!INCLUDE [SQL DB service tiers table for elastic pools](../../includes/sql-database-service-tiers-table-elastic-pools.md)]

Each database within a pool also adheres to the single database characteristics for that tier. For example, the Basic pool has a limit for max sessions per pool of 4800 - 28800, but an individual database within a Basic pool has a database limit of 300 sessions.
